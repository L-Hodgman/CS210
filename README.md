SNHU CS210 Course Work

1.) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  For Project 1, the main goal was to develop a running clock that was editable for the user. In Project 2, we had to develope code that had users put in numbers for investment information, then it gave the users how much their investment would grow over the years. It ran until the user hit a choice key, once the key was pressed they were able to add a second, minute, hour, or exit the program. Lastly, Project 3 was to develop code that utilized JNI. The idea was to utilize vectors to store animal records and once the user was done they could save the data to a JNI file.

2.) What did you do particularly well?

  I love working on making the programs as user friendly and fool proof as possible. I try to think of what the user may try or think of inputing, then direct them on inputing the correct information with using different types of loops.

3.) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
 
  Personally, I need to work on using objects more. I used them in Project 2, but they are something I still need more practice on because they are very essential.

4.) Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

5.) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

6.)How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
