# CS210
SNHU CS210 Course Work

1.) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  In Project 2, the main goal was to develope code that had users put in numbers for investment informatio. Then, the program shows the users how much their investment would grow based on the users input of the initial investment amount, monthly deposits, annual interest rate, how many years they would grow it.
  
2.) What did you do particularly well?

  I love working on making programs as user friendly and fool proof as possible. I try to think of what the user may try or think of inputing, then direct them on inputing the correct information with using different types of loops.

3.) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
 
  Personally, I need to work on using objects more and get more familiar with them. I used them in this project, but they are something I still need more practice on because they are very essential. I also think I need to work on creating more methods instead of putting most of the code in the main method.

4.) Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  
  One difficulty I had writing this code was figuring out how to line up the columns to look neat. Which, eventually I figured it out by googling the issue. Another difficulty was how to structure the header file, but I utilized the examples in ZyBooks to help me build it properly.

5.) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

  The use of objects will be the most useful to other projects.

6.)How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I tried to explain each part of the code and have good white space to make it easy to read and understand.
